# Customize CSS

A (s)css framework focusing on custom properties, utility classes and Atomic Design princables.

Utilities. Components. I believe in both.  

Use self contained styles for components, and utilities for layout, spacing, typography and other more generic properties.

Components generally do not need to know anything about where or how they are set on a page. They only need to be concerned with their own internal compisition.  

Use utility classes to lay out each component on a page.
